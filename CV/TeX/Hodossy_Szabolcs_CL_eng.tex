I am a soon to graduate Mathematics major at Budapest University of Technology, but I have been working at Nokia since 2014 as a Software Engineer, and from April as a Data Analyst Lead. I was always a science enthusiast, therefore I am interested in your Data Scientist job opening.

At university, first I learned physics, but later I drifted to probability theory, and later I have started to take interest in machine learning and data mining. As school projects I have created a score card developing program for credit card loans, using various machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Gradient Boosting and Random Forest. I have also developed a model for estimating CVA values (a price correction used to mitigate the risk associated to the counter-party default of a specific deal) for options based on stock price history, getting to know expert combining and Monte Carlo methods. As a data analyst, now I am leading a small group responsible for a BI dashboard for executives. The tasks consist of automated data collection for different KPIs, making connections between various data sources, developing predictive and statistical models and presenting the results using the Power BI application. From time to time we also support other organization units to extract more information from their data.

I believe that this combination of knowledge is not so common, and can make me a strong candidate for this job. The practice I have acquired during my academic years as a trainee, and the scientific approach secured during my education combined with my history in Nokia ensures that I am qualified for this job.

I hope I managed to arouse your interest in me as a successful applicant for the job. I am looking forward your answer!
